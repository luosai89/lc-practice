/**
 * Reflections
 * 2021
 * 9/10 (1R)
 * My original idea involves using a stack initialized with (0,0). When to use stack vs directly look for the first
 * char? In other words, why can't we use dfs from (0,0)? If we dfs from (0,0). If it's not expected char, we cannot
 * mark it as visited. Say in "SEE", we found a correct E, but we are looking for S. If we mark visited, then it's
 * invisible to us. If we do not mark visited, then we might keep visiting it. We could use "offered" to check if its
 * already on our plan to visit. However it will take forever to find the start, it's better to just iterate. However, I
 * am still not clear how to think of this from the beginning.

/**
 * Time complexity
 * The complexity will be ùëÇ(r * c * 4^s). r = rows, c = columns, s = string length
 * When we start searching from a character we have 4 choices of neighbors for the first character and subsequent
 * characters have only 3 or less than 3 choices but we can take it as 4 (permissible slopiness in upper bound).
 * This slopiness would be fine in large matrices. So for each character we have 4 choices. Total no. of characters are
 * ùë† where s is the length of the input string. So one invocation of search function of your implementation would take
 * ùëÇ(4ùë†) time. Also in worst case the search is invoked for r * c times. So an upper bound would be ùëÇ(r * c * 4^s).
