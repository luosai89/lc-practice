 * URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.

 * that you are given the "true" length of the string.
 * (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
 * EXAMPLE Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13 Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
